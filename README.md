# Chinese Acrostic Poem Generation with LSTM

This project explores the generation of Chinese acrostic poems using a character-level LSTM model built with PyTorch. The model learns to generate coherent and meaningful poetry, constrained by user-defined acrostic characters.

Main highlights:
- Supports head-character (藏头) constraints in generation
- Trained on a classical Chinese poetry corpus
- Tuned with various loss functions and optimizers to enhance fluency and rhyme quality

This work demonstrates the potential of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in creative natural language generation.
